## 🔧 Usage

### Local Development
```bash
# Run security checks locally
cd backend
npm run security:check

# Run npm audit
npm run security:audit

# Run full security suite
npm run security:full
```

### GitHub Actions
The security pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `main`, `pipeline`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 6 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

## 🛡️ Security Checks Included

### 1. 🌐 Environment Security
- Environment variable validation
- .env file security
- Git configuration security
- Secrets exposure prevention

### 2. 📦 Dependency Security
- Known vulnerability scanning
- Deprecated package detection
- License compliance checking
- Dependency tree analysis

### 3. 🔍 Code Security
- Advanced secret detection
- Dangerous code pattern analysis
- Cryptographic implementation review
- OWASP Top 10 verification

### 4. 🏗️ Infrastructure Security
- Docker configuration security
- Network security settings
- CORS configuration analysis
- Security headers verification

### 5. 🚀 Runtime Security
- Authentication mechanism testing
- Authorization flow validation
- API endpoint security testing
- JWT security verification

## 📊 Security Scoring

The pipeline calculates a security score based on:
- **Critical Issues**: -20 points each
- **High Issues**: -10 points each
- **Medium Issues**: -5 points each
- **Low Issues**: -2 points each

### Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: 🏆 Excellent
- **75-89**: 🥉 Good
- **50-74**: ⚠️ Needs Improvement
- **0-49**: 🚨 Critical Attention Required

## 🎯 Security Features

### Current Security Implementations
- ✅ Arcjet protection (rate limiting, bot detection, email validation)
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Helmet security headers
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### Enhanced Security Measures Added
- 🔍 Comprehensive secret scanning
- 📊 Advanced dependency analysis
- 🔐 Cryptographic security verification
- 🛡️ OWASP Top 10 compliance checking
- 📋 Security logging and monitoring
- 🚨 Real-time threat detection

## 🚨 Alert Thresholds

The pipeline will fail if:
- Any critical security issues are found
- High severity vulnerabilities are detected
- Secrets are exposed in code
- Dangerous code patterns are present
- Security misconfigurations are detected

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Weekly dependency vulnerability scans
- Continuous code security analysis
- Real-time secret detection
- Security configuration monitoring

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly security assessments
- Penetration testing (recommended)
- Security policy updates
- Incident response planning

## 📚 Security Resources

### Documentation
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/security/)
- [npm Security Guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/security)

### Tools Used
- ESLint Security Plugin
- npm audit
- Arcjet Security Platform
- Custom security scanners
- OWASP compliance checkers

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Security Checks
1. Update the GitHub workflow file
2. Extend the security-check.sh script
3. Add new security rules to ESLint config
4. Update security thresholds as needed

### Configuration Files
- `.github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml` - Main security workflow
- `scripts/security-check.sh` - Comprehensive security scanner
- `backend/.eslintrc.security.js` - Security-focused linting rules
- `backend/package.json` - Security scripts and dependencies

## 📞 Support
