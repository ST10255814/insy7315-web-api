# Security Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This repository now includes a comprehensive security pipeline with multiple layers of protection:

## Usage

### Local Development
```bash
# Run security checks locally
cd backend
npm run security:check

# Run npm audit
npm run security:audit

# Run full security suite
npm run security:full
```

### GitHub Actions
The security pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `main`, `pipeline`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 6 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Security Checks Included

### 1. Environment Security
- Environment variable validation
- .env file security
- Git configuration security
- Secrets exposure prevention

### 2. Dependency Security
- Known vulnerability scanning
- Deprecated package detection
- License compliance checking
- Dependency tree analysis

### 3. Code Security
- Advanced secret detection
- Dangerous code pattern analysis
- Cryptographic implementation review
- OWASP Top 10 verification

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- Docker configuration security
- Network security settings
- CORS configuration analysis
- Security headers verification

### 5. Runtime Security
- Authentication mechanism testing
- Authorization flow validation
- API endpoint security testing
- JWT security verification

## Security Scoring

The pipeline calculates a security score based on:
- **Critical Issues**: -20 points each
- **High Issues**: -10 points each
- **Medium Issues**: -5 points each
- **Low Issues**: -2 points each

### Score Ranges:
- **90-100**: Excellent
- **75-89**: Good
- **50-74**: Needs Improvement
- **0-49**: Critical Attention Required

## Security Features

### Current Security Implementations
- Arcjet protection (rate limiting, bot detection, email validation)
- JWT authentication
- bcrypt password hashing
- Helmet security headers
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization

### Enhanced Security Measures Added
- Comprehensive secret scanning
- Advanced dependency analysis
- Cryptographic security verification
- OWASP Top 10 compliance checking
- Security logging and monitoring
- Real-time threat detection

## Alert Thresholds

The pipeline will fail if:
- Any critical security issues are found
- High severity vulnerabilities are detected
- Secrets are exposed in code
- Dangerous code patterns are present
- Security misconfigurations are detected

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Weekly dependency vulnerability scans
- Continuous code security analysis
- Real-time secret detection
- Security configuration monitoring

### Manual Reviews
- Quarterly security assessments
- Penetration testing (recommended)
- Security policy updates
- Incident response planning

## Security Resources

### Documentation
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/security/)
- [npm Security Guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/security)

### Tools Used
- ESLint Security Plugin
- npm audit
- Arcjet Security Platform
- Custom security scanners
- OWASP compliance checkers

## Customization

### Adding New Security Checks
1. Update the GitHub workflow file
2. Extend the security-check.sh script
3. Add new security rules to ESLint config
4. Update security thresholds as needed

### Configuration Files
- `.github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml` - Main security workflow
- `scripts/security-check.sh` - Comprehensive security scanner
- `backend/.eslintrc.security.js` - Security-focused linting rules
- `backend/package.json` - Security scripts and dependencies

## Support

For security concerns or questions:
1. Review the security pipeline logs
2. Check the generated security reports
3. Consult the security documentation
4. Contact the development team for urgent issues
